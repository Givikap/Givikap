<h1 align='center'><samp><strong>Hello <s>World</s> Github, I am Kaito Sekiya</strong></samp></h1>
<p align='center'>CS Student @ UIC | Undergraduate Research Assistant | Course Tracker</p>

<h3>About me:</h3>

First programming language I learned was PascalABC.NET, a modernized version of Pascal. Yes, you read that right, good old Pascal. Apparently, my middle school used a textbook that has not been updated in years. Yet, it became a great foundation when I learned C++ in high school and Python through an online course. Or when I worked on my first project - a mobile game developed with Unity and written in C# where you place blocks to build a tower as high as you can until it collapses. 

Now, I am a sophomore student studying Computer Science at University of Illinois at Chicago, an undergraduate research assistant for a CS faculty, and a Course Tracker for UIC Trackers. 
Here at UIC, there are more resources available to me than I ever could access on my own or online. So far, I learned data structures, discrete mathematics, statistics, basics of Assembly, and Turing machines. And I am excited to learn more, especially about systems programming, compilers and algorithms.

My current position at UIC CS department as URA allows me to utilize and develop further my programming and analytical skills. By analyzing and visualizing data I contribute to improving the quality of CS teaching here at UIC. 

Joining UIC Trackers made me connected with the CS community here at UIC, such a large yet commuter school. And becoming Course Tracker was my way to give back to the community by helping other students. And if you are a CS student at UIC, consider joining Trackers.

Currently, I am seeking an internship for Summer 2024 in backend, analytics or data science. I am also considering roles in game and web development. Feel free to message me or contact me at kaitosekiya@outlook.com to discuss my qualifications further. Or just explore my Github profile or links above.
